SecureCheck: A Python-SQL Digital Ledger for Police Post Logs
SecureCheck is a real-time, interactive system for managing police check post data. This project aims to replace outdated manual logs with a digital solution built using Python, SQL, and Streamlit. It enables data-driven policing, real-time insights, and better public safety.

Problem Statement: Manual logging at police check posts leads to inefficiencies, poor data retrieval, and limited analytical insights. SecureCheck solves this by creating a centralized, SQL-based logging system with real-time data visualization and predictive insights.

üíº Business Use Cases:

‚¶Å	Real-time vehicle and personnel logging.
‚¶Å	Identifying high-risk violations or suspects.  
‚¶Å	Check post efficiency monitoring through data analytics.  
‚¶Å	Crime pattern analysis with Python scripts.  
‚¶Å	Centralized access to check post records across regions.

Project Approach: Python for Data Processing, Database Design (SQL), Streamlit Dashboard.

üîß Tech Stack:

‚¶Å	Language: Python  
‚¶Å	Database: PyMySQL / PostgreSQL  
‚¶Å	Framework: Streamlit  
‚¶Å	Libraries: pandas, sqlalchemy, pymysql  
‚¶Å	Deployment: Streamlit Cloud or Localhost

SQL QUERIES :

1.	What are the top 10 vehicle_Number involved in drug-related stops?
2.	Which vehicles were most frequently searched?
3.	Which driver age group had the highest arrest rate?
4.	What is the gender distribution of drivers stopped in each country?
5.	Which race and gender combination has the highest search rate?
6.	What time of day sees the most traffic stops?
7.	What is the average stop duration for different violations?
8.	Are stops during the night more likely to lead to arrests?
9.	Which violations are most associated with searches or arrests?
10.	Which violations are most common among younger drivers (<25)?
11.	Is there a violation that rarely results in search or arrest?
12.	Which countries report the highest rate of drug-related stops?
13.	What is the arrest rate by country and violation?
14.	Which country has the most stops with search conducted?
15.	Yearly Breakdown of Stops and Arrests by Country (Using Subquery and Window Functions).
16.	Driver Violation Trends Based on Age and Race (Join with Subquery).
17.	Time Period Analysis of Stops (Joining with Date Functions) , Number of Stops by Year,Month, Hour of the Day.
18.	Violations with High Search and Arrest Rates (Window Function).
19.	Driver Demographics by Country (Age, Gender, and Race).
20.	Top 5 Violations with Highest Arrest Rates.

Dataset Explanation:
1Ô∏è‚É£ stop_date ‚Äì The date when the stop happened. 2Ô∏è‚É£ stop_time ‚Äì The time of the stop. 3Ô∏è‚É£ country_name ‚Äì The country where the stop took place. 4Ô∏è‚É£ driver_gender ‚Äì The gender of the driver (Male or Female). 5Ô∏è‚É£ driver_age_raw ‚Äì The recorded age of the driver (before cleaning). 6Ô∏è‚É£ driver_age ‚Äì The actual age of the driver (after cleaning). 7Ô∏è‚É£ driver_race ‚Äì The race/ethnicity of the driver. 8Ô∏è‚É£ violation_raw ‚Äì The original reason for the stop (before cleaning). 9Ô∏è‚É£ violation ‚Äì The type of violation (Speeding, DUI, etc.). üîü search_conducted ‚Äì Whether the police searched the driver or vehicle (True/False). 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ search_type ‚Äì The type of search (Frisk, Vehicle Search, etc.). 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ stop_outcome ‚Äì The result of the stop (Warning, Citation, Arrest). 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ is_arrested ‚Äì Whether the driver was arrested (True/False). 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ stop_duration ‚Äì How long the stop lasted (<5 min, 6-15 min, etc.). 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ drugs_related_stop ‚Äì Whether the stop was drug-related (True/False).

Sample Insight: "A 27-year-old male was stopped for Speeding at 2:30 PM. No search conducted. He received a citation. The stop lasted 6‚Äì15 minutes and was not drug-related."
